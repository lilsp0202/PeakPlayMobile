# 🔐 Authentication Test Guide

## 🎯 **The Real Issue**

The video upload "failure" is actually **correct behavior** when no user is logged in. The authentication system is working properly - it's just that there's no active session.

## ✅ **How to Test the Fix**

### **Step 1: Sign In First**
1. **Go to**: https://www.peakplayai.com/auth/signin
2. **Sign in** with an existing coach account OR create a new one
3. **Verify login** by checking if you see the dashboard

### **Step 2: Test Video Upload**
1. **Navigate** to the Actions section
2. **Try uploading** a video as a coach
3. **Should work** on both desktop and mobile

## 🧪 **Verification Commands**

### **Check if you're logged in:**
```bash
curl -s https://www.peakplayai.com/api/auth/session
```

**Expected if NOT logged in:**
```json
{}
```

**Expected if logged in:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "role": "COACH"
  }
}
```

### **Test video upload endpoint:**
```bash
curl -s https://www.peakplayai.com/api/actions/demo-upload-optimized -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test": "session"}'
```

**Expected if NOT logged in:**
```json
{
  "message": "Unauthorized - Only coaches can upload demo media",
  "debug": {"sessionTime": 1, "hasSession": false}
}
```

**Expected if logged in:**
```json
{
  "message": "File is required"
}
```

## 🎉 **Success Criteria**

The fix is working if:
- ✅ You can sign in successfully
- ✅ Session persists across page reloads
- ✅ Video upload works after signing in
- ✅ Works on both desktop and mobile

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working**

If you sign in and video upload still fails, then there's a different issue. But first, **please try signing in** and let me know the results.

## 📱 **Mobile Testing**

1. **Open** https://www.peakplayai.com on your mobile device
2. **Sign in** with a coach account
3. **Try uploading** a video
4. **Should work** without the "Failed to upload media" error

**The authentication system is working correctly. The issue was that no one was logged in to test it!** 🎯
