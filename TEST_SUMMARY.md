# PeakPlay Test Summary

## Current Status

### âœ… Working Tests
- **Simple Unit Tests**: Basic Jest setup confirmed working
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright tests configured and ready

### ðŸ”§ Test Infrastructure Setup

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Jest configured with Next.js support
   - React Testing Library installed
   - Test coverage thresholds set (70% minimum)

2. **E2E Testing** 
   - Playwright configured
   - Authentication flow tests created

3. **API Testing**
   - Test structure created for API endpoints
   - Validation testing patterns established

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

### 1. Component Test Mismatches
- **Issue**: Some test files were created for components that don't exist or have different implementations
- **Solution**: Removed mismatched tests, need to create tests based on actual component implementations

### 2. Module Import Errors
- **Issue**: Some modules (like next-auth) have complex dependencies that cause issues in test environment
- **Solution**: Proper mocking setup in jest.setup.js

### 3. Environment Variables
- **Issue**: Tests need proper environment variables
- **Solution**: Set up test environment variables in jest.setup.js

## Next Steps for Complete Test Coverage

### 1. Component Tests Needed
- [ ] SkillSnap component
- [ ] OverallStats component  
- [ ] RecentMatchScores component
- [ ] BadgeDisplay component (matching actual implementation)
- [ ] CookieConsent component
- [ ] PWAWrapper component

### 2. API Route Tests Needed
- [ ] /api/auth/register
- [ ] /api/badges
- [ ] /api/skills
- [ ] /api/matches
- [ ] /api/student/profile
- [ ] /api/coach/profile

### 3. Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Authentication flow
- [ ] Data fetching and caching
- [ ] Form submissions
- [ ] File uploads

### 4. E2E Tests Needed
- [ ] Complete user journey (signup â†’ onboarding â†’ dashboard)
- [ ] Coach workflow (view students â†’ give feedback)
- [ ] Student workflow (view stats â†’ upload scorecard)
- [ ] Marketplace booking flow

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Structure**
   ```typescript
   describe('Component/Feature Name', () => {
     describe('scenario', () => {
       it('should do something specific', () => {
         // Arrange
         // Act
         // Assert
       })
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Mock External Dependencies**
   - Database calls
   - API requests
   - Authentication
   - File system operations

3. **Test User Interactions**
   - Click events
   - Form submissions
   - Navigation
   - Error states

4. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Empty states
   - Loading states
   - Error states
   - Boundary conditions

## Coverage Goals

- **Statements**: 70%
- **Branches**: 70%
- **Functions**: 70%
- **Lines**: 70%

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflows are configured for:
- Running tests on every push
- Generating coverage reports
- Running E2E tests before deployment
