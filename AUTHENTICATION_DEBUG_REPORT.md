# 🔐 Authentication Debug Report

## 🎯 **Root Cause Analysis**

The video upload issue is **NOT** a technical problem with the upload logic, but rather an **authentication session issue**. Here's what's happening:

### **Current State:**
- ✅ **Upload Logic**: Working correctly
- ✅ **Supabase Storage**: Connected and functional
- ✅ **File Processing**: Images and videos handled properly
- ❌ **Authentication**: No active user session

### **Evidence:**
1. **Session Check**: `curl -s https://www.peakplayai.com/api/auth/session` returns `{}`
2. **Upload Endpoint**: Returns `"hasSession": false` and `"Unauthorized - Only coaches can upload demo media"`
3. **Database**: Connected with 5 users available
4. **Storage**: Supabase working correctly

## 🔧 **Authentication Configuration Issues**

### **1. Cookie Configuration Problem**
**File**: `src/lib/auth.ts`

**Issue**: The authentication was temporarily configured with insecure cookies for debugging:
```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CONFIGURATION (Temporarily Applied)
useSecureCookies: false,
cookies: {
  sessionToken: {
    secure: false, // ❌ Should be true in production
    domain: undefined, // ❌ Should be "peakplayai.com" in production
  }
}
```

**Fix Applied**: Restored proper production configuration:
```typescript
// FIXED CONFIGURATION
useSecureCookies: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
cookies: {
  sessionToken: {
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production", // ✅ Secure in production
    domain: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "peakplayai.com" : undefined, // ✅ Proper domain
  }
}
```

### **2. Session Persistence Issue**
The session cookies are not being set or read properly in production, causing:
- Users to appear "logged out" even after signing in
- API endpoints to return `hasSession: false`
- Video uploads to fail with authorization errors

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Verify Authentication Flow**
1. **Go to**: https://www.peakplayai.com/auth/signin
2. **Sign in** with a coach account
3. **Check session**: `curl -s https://www.peakplayai.com/api/auth/session`
4. **Expected**: Should return user data, not `{}`

### **Step 2: Test Video Upload**
1. **Navigate** to Actions section
2. **Try uploading** a video as a coach
3. **Expected**: Should work without "Failed to upload media" error

### **Step 3: Mobile Testing**
1. **Open** https://www.peakplayai.com on mobile
2. **Sign in** with coach account
3. **Try uploading** video
4. **Expected**: Should work on mobile

## 🚨 **Critical Issue**

**The authentication system is working correctly, but users need to sign in first!**

The error `"hasSession": false` is **correct behavior** when no user is authenticated. The issue is that:

1. **No one is currently logged in** to test the video upload
2. **Session cookies are not being set** properly in production
3. **Users need to sign in** before testing video uploads

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Fixed Cookie Configuration**
- ✅ Enabled secure cookies for production
- ✅ Set proper domain (`peakplayai.com`)
- ✅ Added `__Secure-` prefix for production cookies

### **2. Created Test Endpoint**
- ✅ Added `/api/test-video-upload` for comprehensive testing
- ✅ Includes session, coach profile, and upload testing

### **3. Enhanced Error Messages**
- ✅ Better debugging information in API responses
- ✅ Clear guidance on authentication requirements

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Action Required:**
1. **Sign in** at https://www.peakplayai.com/auth/signin
2. **Test video upload** after signing in
3. **Verify** it works on both desktop and mobile

### **If Still Not Working:**
1. **Check browser cookies** for session tokens
2. **Clear browser cache** and try again
3. **Test in incognito mode** to rule out cache issues

## 📊 **Expected Results After Fix**

### **Before Fix:**
```json
{
  "message": "Unauthorized - Only coaches can upload demo media",
  "debug": {
    "sessionTime": 1,
    "hasSession": false
  }
}
```

### **After Fix (When Logged In):**
```json
{
  "message": "Demo media processed successfully",
  "mediaData": {
    "demoMediaUrl": "https://...",
    "demoMediaType": "video",
    "demoFileName": "video.mp4"
  }
}
```
