# 🥗 SkillSnap Nutrition Personalization Fix

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved: Cutting/Bulking/Maintaining Toggles Not Appearing**

### 📝 **Problem Description**
User Shreyas had filled out his profile with height (180cm), weight (90kg), and age (22), but the personalized nutrition toggles for cutting, bulking, and maintaining were not appearing in the SkillSnap Nutrition pillar.

### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue was in the data flow between the database and the SkillSnap component:

1. **User Profile Data Exists**: ✅ User had complete profile data (height: 180cm, weight: 90kg, age: 22)
2. **Skills API Missing Data**: ❌ The `/api/skills` endpoint was not including student profile data
3. **Cached Query Issue**: ❌ The `getStudentByUserId` cached query was not selecting height/weight fields

### 🔧 **Technical Fixes Applied**

#### 1. **Updated Skills API** (`src/app/api/skills/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Before: Only returned skills data
return NextResponse.json(skills);

// After: Include student profile data for nutrition personalization
const responseData = {
  ...skills,
  student: {
    studentName: student.studentName,
    age: student.age,
    academy: student.academy,
    height: student.height,
    weight: student.weight
  }
};
return NextResponse.json(responseData);
```

#### 2. **Updated Cached Query** (`src/lib/prisma.ts`)
```typescript
// Before: Missing nutrition-related fields
select: {
  id: true,
  studentName: true,
  academy: true,
  sport: true,
  coachId: true,
  userId: true
}

// After: Include height, weight, age for nutrition personalization
select: {
  id: true,
  studentName: true,
  academy: true,
  sport: true,
  coachId: true,
  userId: true,
  height: true,
  weight: true,
  age: true
}
```

### ✅ **Expected Result**
After these changes, users with complete profile data (height, weight, age) will now see:
- **Nutrition Goal Toggles**: Cutting 🏃, Maintaining ⚖️, Bulking 🏋️
- **Personalized Calorie Targets**: Based on BMR and activity level
- **Custom Macro Targets**: Protein, carbs, fats tailored to goals
- **Realistic Scoring**: Nutrition scores based on proximity to personalized targets

### 🎉 **Feature Benefits**
- **Goal-Based Nutrition**: Different targets for cutting (-15%), maintaining (0%), bulking (+15%)
- **Activity Level Adjustment**: Sedentary to very intense activity multipliers
- **Sex-Specific Calculations**: Male/female BMR differences accounted for
- **Realistic Scoring Curve**: Forgiving 12% deviation still scores 83%

### 🔄 **Data Flow Verification**
1. User fills profile → Student table (height, weight, age)
2. Cached query includes all fields → Skills API returns complete data
3. SkillSnap receives student profile → NutritionTracker shows personalized toggles
4. User selects goal → Custom targets calculated and displayed

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Nutrition personalization now fully functional
